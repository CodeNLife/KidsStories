            <p>Once upon a time, in a bright little village, there lived a curious girl named <strong>Tara</strong>. She loved to explore the forest behind her home.</p>

            <p>One sunny morning, Tara found a giant tree with golden leaves. When she touched it, the tree spoke softly, “Hello, little one.”</p>

            <p>Surprised but excited, Tara smiled. “You can talk?” she asked.</p>

            <p>“Yes,” said the tree. “I speak only to kind hearts. Will you help me care for the forest?”</p>

            <p>Tara nodded happily and promised to protect the plants and animals. From that day, the forest grew greener, and Tara’s kindness spread like sunshine.</p>
