        <p>
            Once upon a time, in a green forest full of flowers and trees, lived a little rabbit named <strong>Bunny</strong>.
            Bunny was fast, playful, and loved hopping around all day.
        </p>

        <p>
            One warm afternoon, Bunny felt very thirsty. He hopped deeper into the forest and found a beautiful lake.
            The water sparkled like diamonds. It was a <strong>magic lake</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bunny drank the water happily. Soon, other animals came — a deer, a squirrel, and a little bird.
            They all wanted water too.
        </p>

        <p>
            Bunny thought for a moment. Instead of keeping the lake to himself, he smiled and said,
            “Let us all share the lake. There is enough water for everyone.”
        </p>

        <p>
            The lake glowed brighter, and a gentle voice said,
            “Sharing brings happiness.”
        </p>

        <p>
            From that day on, Bunny and his friends shared everything — water, food, and love.
            The forest became a happier place.
        </p>
